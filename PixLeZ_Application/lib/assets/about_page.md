# PixLeZ - About

PixLeZ was originally created by Tobias Schreiweis in 2020.  

It started as a private project with the main focus to improve his python skills with the Raspberry Pi and learning new programing languages like dart with the framework flutter. After some requests from other people getting the application he decided to publish it on GitHub.

You are welcome to extend the PixLeZ-Bundle or send in your ideas and we would be glad to add your code and ideas to this repository.
