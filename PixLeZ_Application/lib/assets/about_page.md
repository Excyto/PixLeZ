# PixLeZ - About

PixLeZ is created by Tobias Schreiweis in 2020.  

It started as a private project with the main focus to improve my python skills with the Raspberry Pi and learning new programing languages like dart with the framework flutter. After some request from other peoples getting the application I decided to publish it on GitHub.

You are welcome to extend the PixLeZ-Bundle or send me your ideas and I would be glad about adding your code and ideas to this repository.

If I can be of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.
