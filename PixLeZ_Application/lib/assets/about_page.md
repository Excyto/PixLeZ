# PixLeZ - About

PixLeZ was originally created by [Tobias Schreiweis](https://github.com/Excyto) in 2020.  
Later, [Timo](https://github.com/TheRisenPhoenix) joined as a maintainer and contributor.

It started as a private project with the main focus to improve their python skills with the Raspberry Pi and learning new programing languages like dart with the framework flutter. After some requests from other people getting the application Tobias decided to publish it on GitHub.

You are welcome to extend the PixLeZ-Bundle or send us your ideas and we will be glad to add your code and ideas to this repository.
